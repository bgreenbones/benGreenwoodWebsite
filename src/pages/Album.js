      <h2>Recording Emilie Mayer's Violin Sonatas</h2>
    <div className="album-section">
      <div className="album-paragraph">Ben Greenwood is embarking on our first large-scale recording project, involving two sonatas by German Romantic composer Emilie Mayer (1812-1883). Mayer wrote nine sonatas for violin and piano, and from this collection we have selected the D minor Sonata (Op. 29) and the D Major sonata. This will likely be the first time that our audiences hear these two works, which are rarely performed and to our knowledge, have not been previously recorded. To best represent the music in its historical context, we read from original manuscripts or first editions whenever possible. </div>
